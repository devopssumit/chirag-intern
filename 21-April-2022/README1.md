### Assignment

- Classification on the basis of topic wise clarity and doubt among us interns regarding OOP.
- Discussed among us interns about how to solve the Cartesian problem
- Had session with Vishal Sir and Abrar Sir to implement OOP concepts in python.
- Create class Point defining its attributes and behaviour and test it.

### Doubts

- Had doubts in understanding when to use inheritance and difference between bottom-up and top-down approach. Doubt resolved in discussion with Vishal Sir and Abrar Sir.
- Recommended to use bottom-up approach. And to define the problem in terms of statements like " A is a B" or " A has a B" to distinguish between when to use inheritance and when to use composition or data attributes.
