## First Half

- StandUp call with Team

- ðŸ”„Designing Graph Plot using Object Oriented Programming : In Progress

### Videos

- N/A

### Assignment

- âœ…Added three new methods in the graph assignment to calcluate distance between points named as
  ```
  1. distance_from_coordinate_of_point
  2. distance_from_point_object
  3. distance_from_origin
  ```

### Doubts

- Problem in Pycharm Docstring format [Epytext] Pycharm does not auto-create documentation stubs.

```
---> Solution: In order to solve this problem, I had to go into Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools and reset the docstring format. I did so by changing Docstring format from Epytext to Plain, clicking Apply, then changing it back to Epytext again and applying the change, and now everything works.
