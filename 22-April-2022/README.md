### Doubts

- Problem in Pycharm Docstring format [Epytext] Pycharm does not auto-create documentation stubs.

```
  - Solution: In order to solve this problem, I had to go into Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools and reset the docstring format. I did so by changing Docstring format from Epytext to Plain, clicking Apply, then changing it back to Epytext again and applying the change, and now everything works.
```
